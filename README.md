# Heart-disease-prediction-model

Introduction


This GitHub project houses a heart disease prediction model. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of an individual having heart disease based on various features and risk factors.

Prerequisites


Before running the heart disease prediction model, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

Python (version 3.10.3)
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Data

The dataset used in this project can be found in the data directory. It contains various attributes such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, etc., which will be used to predict the presence of heart disease.

Please note that the data provided here is for demonstration purposes only and is not suitable for real-world medical analysis.

Model


The heart disease prediction model is built using a machine learning algorithm, specifically Random forest classifier. It is trained on the provided dataset and used to make predictions.


Results


The performance of the heart disease prediction model is evaluated using [metrics], and the results are discussed in the Jupyter Notebook.
